This directory contains the verilog source files that I wrote for a college class CompE-475 and all of the verilog included was written by me. The verilog written for this class is split up into three main subdirectories: Single Cycle, Multi Cycle, and Pipeline. In terms of chronology I wrote the single cycle then the multicycle and lastly the pipeline processor. For testing I wrote Mips programs which were translated to machine code and stored in the instruction memory.
